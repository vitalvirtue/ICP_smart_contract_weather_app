# ICP_smart_contract_weather_app

This project is a weather data fetcher that retrieves weather data for a specific location using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Overview

The contract is written in Rust and uses the Internet Computer's `ic_cdk` and `ic_cdk_macros` libraries to interact with the Internet Computer. It also uses the `serde` and `candid` libraries for data serialization and deserialization.

The contract fetches weather data such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed for the city of Ankara, Turkey.

## How the Contract Works

The contract uses the `http_request` function from the `ic_cdk::api::management_canister::http_request` module to send an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API. The request is sent with a URL that includes the city and country code, as well as an API key for OpenWeatherMap.

The response from the API is a JSON object that includes various weather data. This data is parsed and stored in a `WeatherData` struct, which is then returned by the `get_weather_data` function.

If the HTTP request fails for any reason, the `get_weather_data` function returns an error message.

## Data Structures

The contract uses two main data structures:

- `WeatherData`: This structure holds the weather data. It includes fields for temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed.
- `State`: This structure holds the state of the contract. It includes a field for weather data.

## Functionality

The contract exposes one function:

- `get_weather_data`: This function fetches the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and returns it. If the fetch is successful, it returns the weather data. If the fetch fails, it returns an error message.

## Candid Interface

The contract's Candid interface is defined in a separate Candid file. It defines the `WeatherData` and `Result` types and the `get_weather_data` function.

## Deployment

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd ICP_smart_contract_weather_app/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
